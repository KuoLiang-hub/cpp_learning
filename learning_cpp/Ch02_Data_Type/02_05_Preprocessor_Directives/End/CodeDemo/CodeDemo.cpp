// Preprocessor directives, by Eduardo Corpe√±o 

/* your code is preprocessed prior to compiling
 * directives tell the processor what to add or remove in the code
 * useful for libraries, constants, selecting code blocks, etc
*/

#include <iostream>   //all directives start with a number or #. one line each.
                      //iostream is a standard library, so it does not inlcude .h, .hpp;
                      //within <> means it will search a pre-defined location, usually defined by the PATH,
                      //you can think this a known standard library.
#include <string>     //within <> means it will search a pre-defined location, usually defined by the PATH,
#include <cstdint>    //its a c library, therefore a c infront of it.
