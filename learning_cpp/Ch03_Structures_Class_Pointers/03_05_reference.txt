reference is special data type.
it's alias for existing variables.
use reference
	type& ref_name = var_name;
	int& my_ref = my_int;

no need to dereference ref, life pointers.
reference is not a pointer,
reference is not a object.
reference doesn't have address.
	no arrays of references
	no pointer to reference
	no reference to reference.

difference between pointers & references:
	pointers						references
	initialization is optional 		must be initialized at declaration.
	can point to different objects	can't reference a 2nd object
	can be void and NULL			fix data type and object.
	Multiple level of indirection	one level of indirection
	must be dereferenced			no need for dereferencing.

application.
	passing parameters by reference.
	avoid copying large objects as function parameters.
	avoid copying large objects in for loops
